COMPLETE DESIGN & SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT
(Version: 1.0.0 — for internal planning and code-generation)

1. PURPOSE & OVERVIEW

This software project provides a Go code generator and runtime support library that automatically produces JSON Schemas from Go types, with special considerations for LLM usage (e.g., ChatGPT function calling). The primary motivations are:
1.	Structured LLM Responses: You want to instruct an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Anthropic) on exactly how to format its output—via a well-defined JSON schema or a “tool function definition.”
2.	Automatic Generation: Eliminates hand-written schemas by analyzing your Go types, doc comments, and struct tags.
3.	Extensibility: Uses a Chain-of-Responsibility plugin system to customize how each type is handled (e.g., time.Time → “string with date-time format,” blacklisted types → error, interface union expansions, etc.).
4.	Two-Phase Artifact:
•	Phase 1: Generate .json schemas into a jsonschema/ directory.
•	Phase 2: Generate a Go file that embeds those .json schemas (via embed.FS) and optionally provides unmarshaler functions (with validation) so your program can handle structured data at runtime.

High-Level Objectives
•	Support a subset of JSON Schema sufficient for LLM usage (strings, numbers, arrays, objects, optional recursion up to a safe limit, union types).
•	Ignore advanced features like allOf/oneOf/anyOf in the first version, but we have a path to add them in future expansions.
•	Reject or error out on blacklisted types (channels, funcs, maps, inline interfaces, circular references, etc.) or deeply nested structs beyond a certain depth.
•	Doc Comments can be used as descriptions for fields/types; struct tags (json:"...") may later override property names.
•	Potential to track enumerated constants for “enums” in JSON schema, or doc comment annotations for “discriminators,” etc.
•	Runtime usage includes feeding these schemas to ChatGPT or another LLM for generating structured responses.

2. CORE FUNCTIONALITY
    1.	Go Package Loading
          •	Uses golang.org/x/tools/go/packages (or equivalent) to load the target package(s).
          •	Resolves all named types, doc comments, struct fields, etc.
          •	Enforces no blacklisted constructs: if discovered (e.g., channel, func, or inline interface), the generator fails with an error.
          •	Optionally detects marker calls or struct tags for advanced usage (to be expanded upon).
    2.	Chain-of-Responsibility Transformers
          •	We define a chain of transformers, each implementing an interface like:

type NamedTypeTransformer interface {
Claim(id TypeIdentity) bool
Transform(named *types.Named) (json.Marshaler, error)
}


	•	The chain is short-circuited: the first transformer that “claims” the type will produce the final schema data (in the form of a json.Marshaler).
	•	Examples:
	•	TimeTransformer: If type == time.Time, produce a schema with "type":"string","format":"date-time".
	•	BlacklistTransformer: If type is blacklisted (e.g., sync.Mutex), return an error.
	•	DefaultTransformer: If no special logic applies, parse struct fields, fill a JSONSchema object, etc.

	3.	In-Memory Representation
	•	We maintain an internal Go structure (e.g., type JSONSchema struct { ... }) that implements json.Marshaler.
	•	Nested types become nested JSONSchema references (e.g., for struct fields or array elements).
	•	We can add fields for description, enum, required, properties, etc.
	•	Future expansions can add fields for oneOf, anyOf, $defs, or a discriminator pattern.
	4.	Two-Phase Artifact Output
	1.	Phase 1: Writes each type’s schema as .json into a jsonschema/ subdirectory.
	2.	Phase 2: Generates a Go file (e.g., schemas_generated.go) that:
	•	Embeds the entire jsonschema/*.json directory using Go’s embed.FS.
	•	Optionally provides top-level functions (e.g., func MyTypeSchema() json.RawMessage) that load the embedded .json file.
	•	Optionally provides func UnmarshalMyType(data []byte) (MyType, error) which first validates data against MyType.json via a JSON schema validation library, then unmarshals into MyType.
	•	This approach ensures the schemas are available at runtime for LLM interactions or validations.
	5.	Stub + Marker Function Approach (Optional)
	•	If you want a runtime method (MyType) Schema() or you want to reference generated code in normal builds, you can keep a minimal “stub” that compiles even if the generated file is missing.
	•	A marker function (like var _ = schemagen.SchemaFor[MyType](MyType.Schema)) helps the generator locate the correct type → function reference.
	•	This avoids compile failures if the generated file is temporarily deleted.
	•	In simpler usage, you can skip stubs and just rely on the chain + explicit file generation.

3. DESIGN DETAILS

3.1 Blacklisted & Unsupported Types
•	chan and func → immediate error.
•	map → error for now (maybe we add map[string]X support in future).
•	inline interface → error. We only handle interface usage via a union approach with a known set of implementations.
•	circular references → detect via a “visited named types” set. If we re-enter the same type, we fail.

3.2 Maximum Depth Limit
•	The generator enforces a maximum struct nesting depth (default 6 or so) to comply with LLM function-calling constraints. Exceeding that triggers an error.

3.3 Interface Union Support (Future)
•	We plan to represent an interface field as a union of known implementations, each with a distinct schema, possibly with a discriminator property.
•	The chain might have a specialized “InterfaceTransformer” that sees if the user has declared:

var _ = schemagen.DeclareImpl[MyInterface](Impl1{}, Impl2{}, &Impl3{})


	•	Then it produces something like {"anyOf":[schemaForImpl1, schemaForImpl2, schemaForImpl3]} or a custom approach ({"discriminator":"__type__"}).
	•	In the first version, we do not handle this automatically. We just fail if we see an interface or skip it. The union logic can be introduced as a new transformer.

3.4 Doc Comments & Struct Tags
•	Doc Comments become description fields in the JSON schema. The loader extracts them from ast or packages.Load syntax.
•	Struct Tags: If the field has json:"foo" or json:"-" in a struct tag, we can eventually interpret that (rename the property, skip it, etc.).
•	In v1, we might ignore or partially handle tags, focusing primarily on the field’s Go name.
•	Expanding doc comment usage is also straightforward in the chain or default transformer.

3.5 Enumerations
•	If a type has a set of const declarations in the same package (like type Color string + const Red Color = "red" …), we can automatically produce "enum": ["red", "green", "blue"].
•	This would be handled by a specialized transformer or by adding logic to the default transformer if it sees a named type with recognized constants.

3.6 Chain-of-Responsibility Implementation
•	We define something like:

type TransformerChain struct {
Transformers []NamedTypeTransformer
}

func (c *TransformerChain) GenerateSchema(named *types.Named) (json.Marshaler, error) {
id := getTypeIdentity(named)
for _, xf := range c.Transformers {
if xf.Claim(id) {
return xf.Transform(named)
}
}
return nil, fmt.Errorf("no transformer claimed %s.%s", id.PkgPath, id.Name)
}


	•	Each link has a straightforward .Claim(...) bool and .Transform(...) (json.Marshaler, error).
	•	Short-Circuit: The first link that returns true on Claim is the one that performs the transform.

3.7 Two-Phase Generation
1.	Phase 1:
•	For each target type, invoke chain.GenerateSchema(...).
•	Marshal that schema object to JSON (using json.MarshalIndent).
•	Write it to jsonschema/<TypeName>.json.
2.	Phase 2:
•	Generates a file schemas_generated.go (or similar) that has:

//go:embed jsonschema/*.json
var schemaFS embed.FS

func MyTypeSchema() (json.RawMessage, error) {
data, err := schemaFS.ReadFile("jsonschema/MyType.json")
if err != nil { ... }
return data, nil
}

func UnmarshalMyType(data []byte) (MyType, error) {
// 1. read MyType.json from schemaFS
// 2. run JSON schema validation (if present)
// 3. json.Unmarshal into MyType
}


	•	This ensures your application can load and use these schemas at runtime.

4. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE (SUGGESTED)

└── go.mod / main.go / ...

	•	loader: minimal read/parse to get Go types, doc comments, etc.
	•	schema: definition of the JSONSchema model and related types.
	•	transformers: each specialized transformer plus a “chain” aggregator.
	•	generator: the top-level function that calls everything, writes artifacts.

5. TESTING STRATEGY
   •	Unit Tests on small components:
   •	Loader tests verifying correct doc comment extraction, erroring on blacklisted types, etc.
   •	Transformers tests ensuring each transformer’s claim logic & schema output are correct.
   •	Schema tests verifying correct JSON generation from your JSONSchema struct.
   •	Integration Tests:
   •	Check that GenerateSchemasForPackage(...) writes correct .json files and a .go file with embedded references.
   •	Possibly parse the generated .json to confirm they match expected structure.

6. EXTENSIONS & FUTURE FEATURES
    1.	Advanced Interface Unions:
          •	Provide a “discriminator” field (like __type__) to unify multiple implementations in a single schema.
          •	Or produce a JSON schema with "anyOf":[...]" or "oneOf":[...].
    2.	Doc Comments for Field Descriptions
          •	Summarize each field’s doc comment in the “description” property.
    3.	Functional Stub Approach
          •	If you want (MyType).Schema() in your normal code, define a no-op stub. The generator then overwrites or overrides it in a separate file with build tags.
    4.	Command-Line vs. Marker Functions
          •	A user might define //go:generate genjsonschema -type=MyType1,MyType2,... or a marker-based approach for picking types.

7. HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT FOR CODE GENERATION

Goal

You want to “paste” this document into a new LLM conversation and say: “Now please write the loader package” or “Now please implement the TimeTransformer”—and the LLM should have all the context needed to do so.

Contents to Provide
•	This Entire Document: So the LLM has the complete architectural context, the reason for each component, how they fit together, and any constraints (like blacklisted types).
•	Instructions: e.g., “Implement the loader package as described in Section 2 and 5. The loader must discover doc comments, handle blacklisted types, etc. Follow the structure from Section 4.”
•	The LLM can then produce a file loader.go with the relevant logic and loader_test.go.

Implementation Guidance
•	Emphasize the “Chain-of-Responsibility” pattern as described.
•	Use the “two-phase” generation approach.
•	Provide sample code stubs for advanced features (time.Time, doc comments) or keep them minimal in an initial pass.

Testing
•	Remind the LLM to create a minimal test fixture (like a local testdata package) or inline definitions for verifying the loader or transformers.
•	The LLM can reference the recommended test structure from Section 5.

8. INSTRUCTIONS FOR MODULE-BY-MODULE IMPLEMENTATION

Below is a concise step-by-step you can give to an LLM in a new conversation:
1.	Loader Module
•	Write loader.go that loads a target package via golang.org/x/tools/go/packages, enumerates named types, extracts doc comments, and returns them in a TypeInfo structure.
•	Provide blacklisted-type detection (chan, func, map, inline interface).
•	Create simple tests in loader_test.go.
2.	Schema Module
•	Define JSONSchema struct with fields for type, properties, required, etc.
•	Possibly implement json.Marshaler if you want custom logic.
•	Write tests that check json.Marshal → expected output.
3.	Transformers
•	chain.go: short-circuited chain that tries each NamedTypeTransformer in order.
•	time_transformer.go: claims time.Time; returns a schema of type "string","format":"date-time".
•	blacklist_transformer.go: errors out if the type is in the blacklist.
•	default_transformer.go: handles normal structs (and soon, enumerations, doc comments).
•	Each with *_test.go for isolated logic checks.
4.	Generator Orchestrator
•	generator.go: the main entry to generate all schemas for a set of types.
•	artifacts.go: writes JSON files to jsonschema/, then generates schemas_generated.go with embed.FS.
•	generator_test.go: integration tests verifying the final files.

By following these steps, each module remains testable and cohesive.

9. CONCLUSION

You Now Have a comprehensive blueprint for a Go-based JSON schema generator tailored to LLM structured responses. This design:
•	Embraces a Chain-of-Responsibility for flexible type transformations.
•	Produces a two-phase artifact (JSON files + embedded Go code).
•	Facilitates doc comment integration and potential interface union expansions.
•	Ensures robust unit testing via separated modules and straightforward integration testing for final outputs.

Next Steps:
•	Paste this entire document into a new LLM session.
•	Ask for the creation of a particular module (e.g., the loader package) per the described architecture.
•	Repeat until all modules are implemented and tested.
