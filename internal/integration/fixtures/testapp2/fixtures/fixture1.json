  "backStory": "Born in a high-tech research facility during a quantum experiment, Nova Chen came into the world as the first baby whose consciousness exists simultaneously in multiple timelines. Her parents, both brilliant scientists, were studying temporal physics when an accident caused a ripple in space-time that coincided with her birth. This unique circumstance gave her the ability to intuitively understand and sometimes manipulate the flow of time, though only in small, localized ways.",
