- Prefers explicit, readable APIs over magic
- Spec-first workflow: spec leads, tests guide, implementation follows
- Unit tests are scaffolding/fungible; examples and spec are priority
- Deterministic outputs and clear, actionable errors
- Strong support for enums (iota, string mode) and interface unions
- CLI ergonomics welcomed when they materially improve DX
