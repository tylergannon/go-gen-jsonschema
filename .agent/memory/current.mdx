Priorities
- Spec-first: docs/spec/v1.md is canonical; design history in docs/design/; read both before coding
- Always ensure green baseline with `go test ./...` and compile generated fixtures

Immediate next steps (v1)
- Add fixtures to validate NewJSONSchemaFunc and NewJSONSchemaBuilder parity with method form
- Implement WithRenderProviders: generate RenderedSchema(); add deterministic rendered goldens
- Implement enum string mode (WithEnum/WithEnumMode/WithEnumName) incl. iota and (un)marshalers
- Implement interface options (WithInterface/WithInterfaceImpls/WithDiscriminator)

Preferences
- Explicit, readable APIs over magic
- Deterministic outputs; clear, actionable errors
- Strong enum and interface support; CLI only if it materially helps DX
